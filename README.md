# La Bamba Mofongo
## Synopsis
LaBamba Mofongo is a restaurant that serves food, beverages, and cuisine from Spanish cultures across the world in an upscale dining-experience in the heart of Flatiron District, NYC.
## Motivation
We created this app to provide our customers with a first-class restaurant-reservation experience.  We want customers to leave our site having made a reservation in easy-to-follow steps and visuals, and to follow through with reservation on commited date(s).

## Languages, Frameworks & Libraries
Express.js was used for the backend framework.  CRUD controlled how reservations were made, deleted and otherwise accessed.  React.js was used on the frontend to control how the website renders in the browser, changing components based on user behavior. We also used react-pdf-js to render the pdf menu in react.
##Target Audience
Target customer profile:
-	appreciates ethnic (to wit, Spanish) cuisine
o	sophisticated palette

-	dining experience is an extension of lifestyle brand (exclusivity/VIP treatment) 
- likes to feel catered to
-	healthy disposable income
-	enjoys family-friendly atmosphere at elegant level, not akin to Applebees family-friendly atmosphere.
-	Attractive to millennials and upper-middle-class patrons/customers

## Installation
Yarn was used as the package manager for project’s dependencies, in addition to package.json.
